## The Big Picture

This batch established the knowledge base's character. Four pillars emerged:

1. **The Pudding's process canon** — Their "How to Make Dope Shit" series and scrollytelling guides set the standard for data storytelling methodology.

2. **Context engineering crystallizes** — LangChain and Weaviate both published foundational context engineering content. The term went from buzzword to discipline.

3. **Tableau exemplars** — A treasure trove of Visual Vocabulary, chart catalogs, and design guides. The craft knowledge that doesn't fit in documentation.

4. **Agent memory research** — Early academic and practitioner work on how agents should handle context and memory.

### Knowledge Engineering (6 resources)

The context engineering wave begins:

**Context Engineering Foundations:**
- [Context Engineering for Agents (LangChain)](https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/) — Defining the discipline
- [Context Engineering Deep Dive (Weaviate)](https://weaviate.io/blog/context-engineering) — Technical foundations
- [Filesystems for Context Engineering](https://blog.langchain.com/how-agents-can-use-filesystems-for-context-engineering/) — Practical patterns

**Key insight:** LangChain's "context engineering" framing gave practitioners a name for what they'd been doing: systematically managing what information reaches the model. It's not just RAG—it's architecture.

## Cross-Cutting Insights

**1. Context engineering is the new differentiator.** LangChain, Weaviate, and AWS all converged on the same message: it's not about bigger models, it's about better context. The term went from niche to mainstream this month.

**2. Craft knowledge lives in Tableau Public.** The Visual Vocabulary, chart catalogs, and design guides are the tacit knowledge that experienced practitioners accumulate. Now it's documented.

**3. The Pudding's process is replicable.** Their "Dope Shit" series isn't just inspirational—it's a methodology. Find your angle → gather data → design with intention.

**4. Agent memory is the unsolved problem.** Four different memory approaches in one batch, none of them definitive. This is where the research frontier is.

**5. MCP is the integration layer.** The Pragmatic Engineer's "USB-C for AI" metaphor captured it. MCP is becoming the standard for tool integration.
