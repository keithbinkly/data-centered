      This intake session surfaced a fascinating tension: we're simultaneously building
      semantic infrastructure for AI agents AND realizing our existing foundations are
      shakier than we thought. Knowledge engineering is eating data engineering—multiple
      authors converging on the same conclusion that the warehouse/lake distinction is
      collapsing into "structured knowledge systems." Meanwhile, the agent tooling explosion
      (8 new repos for agent infrastructure alone) reveals a gap: sophisticated orchestration
      layers on semantic models that don't exist yet. Bergevin's "Figma Moment" thesis
      resonates across resources—we're at the hand-coding HTML stage of semantic work.

      New year, new paradigm. The semantic layer debate went mainstream as MotherDuck
      asked "do we even need this?" while Shopify's taxonomy success answered "yes, if
      you're building for scale." Context graphs emerged as a bridge concept—neither pure
      knowledge graph (too academic) nor pure semantic layer (too metrics-focused). MCP
      moved from spec to infrastructure with MotherDuck shipping a production server.
      Three different projects tackled cross-session memory, confirming it's the unsolved
      frontier. The Inmon-Kimball architecture debate got a sequel, reframed for the AI age.

      A focused batch that crystallized the semantic infrastructure thesis. The debate
      sharpened: MotherDuck asks "do we need this complexity?" while Shopify's success
      answers "yes, at scale" and Vashishta warns "but most attempts will fail anyway."
      Bergevin explains why: the tooling sucks. His "Figma moment" thesis is the most
      actionable insight—we're hand-coding semantic models with no visual tools, version
      control patterns, or component marketplace. Whoever builds "Figma for semantics"
      unlocks the next wave.

      Infrastructure week. The Pudding's entire production stack decoded: SvelteKit +
      Scrollama + Layer Cake, with open-sourced templates, data, and the whole site
      architecture. For scrollytelling, start here. Simultaneously, dbt's semantic layer
      documentation went from sparse to comprehensive—architecture, exports, time spine
      patterns all documented. The official AI learning platforms from OpenAI, Anthropic,
      and Google got catalogued. Memory solutions are fragmenting with no clear winner.
      Karpathy's 1-hour LLM intro remains the best single-resource introduction.

      The batch that established the knowledge base's character. The Pudding's "How to
      Make Dope Shit" series set the standard for data storytelling methodology. Context
      engineering crystallized as LangChain and Weaviate both published foundational
      content—the term went from buzzword to discipline. Tableau's Visual Vocabulary and
      chart catalogs captured the craft knowledge that doesn't fit in documentation.
      Agent memory research emerged with four different approaches in one batch—the
      problem is clear, the solution isn't. MCP became "the USB-C layer for AI."

      Where it started. The seed collection that defined the thesis: data infrastructure
      isn't AI-ready because of missing meaning, not missing pipelines. Jessica Talisman's
      knowledge engineering curriculum—controlled vocabularies through ontologies to
      metadata modeling—became the backbone. The "semantic gap" got named by multiple
      authors from different angles. dbt's semantic layer documentation provided the
      practical implementation. Library science wisdom ("the reference interview")
      offered unexpected insight. The foundation thesis: making data AI-ready is about
      encoding meaning, not scaling storage.
