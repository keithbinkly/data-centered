# Library Update #1: Foundations
**27 resources added | December 2024**

## The Big Picture

This is where it started. The seed collection that defined the knowledge base's focus:

**The core thesis emerged:** Data infrastructure isn't AI-ready. Not because of scale or quality, but because of *meaning*. Semantic layers, ontologies, and context engineering aren't nice-to-haves—they're the missing infrastructure layer.

Three foundational threads:

1. **The semantic gap** — Multiple authors identified the same problem: AI can't "read the room" because our data lacks semantic context.

2. **Jessica Talisman's knowledge engineering curriculum** — A comprehensive series on controlled vocabularies, ontologies, and metadata modeling. This became the backbone.

3. **dbt's semantic layer documentation** — The practical implementation of semantic infrastructure.

### Knowledge Engineering (18 resources)

The dominant category. This is the intellectual foundation:

**The Semantic Gap:**

- [Controlled Vocabularies Part II](https://jessicatalisman.substack.com/p/controlled-vocabularies) — Implementation
- [Controlled Vocabularies Part III](https://jessicatalisman.substack.com/p/controlled-vocabularies) — Advanced patterns

- [Process Knowledge Management II](https://jessicatalisman.substack.com/p/process-knowledge-management-part-ii) — Implementation

**Ontologies & Knowledge Graphs:**
- [Enterprise Needs Ontology](https://vinvashishta.substack.com/p/why-your-agentic-enterprise-needs) — Why ontologies matter for agents
- [Grounding LLMs with Knowledge Graphs](https://medium.com/@alessandro-negro/grounding-llms-the-knowledge-graph-foundation-every-ai-project-needs) — KG + LLM integration
- [Building Knowledge Graphs](https://kurtcagle.wpcomstaging.com/2023/04/18/what-is-a-knowledge-graph-really/) — Practical construction

**Synthesis:** Talisman's series is the curriculum. Start with controlled vocabularies, progress to ontologies, ground in metadata modeling. The other resources provide the "why."

### Analytics Engineering (5 resources)

The dbt semantic layer foundation:

**Semantic Layer Documentation:**
- [Consume Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/consume-metrics) — Querying the semantic layer
- [Administer Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl) — Setup and configuration
- [Deploy Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/deploy-sl) — Production deployment

**Semantic Layer Strategy:**
- [Semantic Layers for Control](https://www.atscale.com/blog/golden-age-of-the-semantic-layer/) — Strategic positioning
- [Building Analyst Agent with dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-agents-remote-dbt-mcp-server-trusted-ai-for-analytics) — Agent integration

**The practical implementation:** dbt's semantic layer is where the theory meets practice. These docs are the reference implementation of semantic infrastructure.

### AI/Agents (4 resources)

Context engineering origins:

- [Context Engineering for AI Agents](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus) — Manus's lessons learned
- [Context Engineering Discipline](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/context-engineering-as-a-discipline-building-gove) — Establishing the discipline
- [AI-Ready Data: Technical Assessment](https://moderndata101.substack.com/p/ai-ready-data-a-technical-assessment) — What AI-readiness actually means
- [Agentic Data Analyst](https://engineering.ramp.com/post/meet-ramp-research) — Ramp's implementation

**The agent connection:** Context engineering isn't just about RAG—it's about making data *available to reasoning*. The Ramp and Manus examples show production implementations.

---

### Meta/Process (1 resource)

- [Librarian's Reference Interview](https://dataintelligenceplatform.substack.com/p/the-librarians-reference-interview) — Information science wisdom for AI

**The library science connection:** The "reference interview" pattern—understanding the question behind the question—is exactly what agents need to do. This resource bridges information science and AI.

---

## Cross-Cutting Insights

**1. The semantic gap is real.** Every author in this batch, from different angles, identified the same problem: our data infrastructure lacks semantic context. AI doesn't fail because of data quality—it fails because of missing meaning.

**2. Jessica Talisman is the curriculum.** Her controlled vocabulary → ontology → metadata modeling progression is the most complete treatment of knowledge engineering fundamentals I've found. Start here.

**3. dbt's semantic layer is the implementation.** The theory (Talisman, Vashishta) meets practice (dbt). For practitioners, this is where to start.

**4. Context engineering is the discipline.** The term "context engineering" appears across multiple sources. It's the emerging discipline that bridges data engineering, knowledge engineering, and AI.

**5. Library science has answers.** The "reference interview" insight is profound: librarians solved the "understand what the user really needs" problem decades ago. We're just now applying it to AI.

## The Foundation Thesis

This collection established the thesis that drives the entire knowledge base:

> **Making data AI-ready isn't about pipelines or storage—it's about encoding meaning.** The missing infrastructure layer is semantic: ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and context engineering that make data *understandable* to reasoning systems.

Everything that follows builds on this foundation.

## What I'm Reading Next

This is the foundation. Read in order:
1. **Talisman's controlled vocabulary series** — The conceptual base
2. **The Semantic Gap** — The problem statement
3. **dbt semantic layer docs** — The implementation
4. **Context Engineering for AI Agents** — The application
